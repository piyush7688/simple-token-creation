# Simple Token Creation

## Project Description
This project provides a Solidity smart contract for creating your own cryptocurrency. It allows users to transfer, approve, mint, and burn tokens, implementing a basic ERC-20-like system without using OpenZeppelin.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to provide a simple and efficient token system that can be easily deployed and used for various blockchain applications such as payments, rewards, and DeFi projects.

## Future Scope
- **Staking Mechanism**: Users can stake tokens to earn rewards.
- **Token Swaps**: Integration with decentralized exchanges (DEX).
- **Governance System**: Token holders can vote on proposals.
- **Multi-Blockchain Support**: Deploying the token on multiple blockchain networks.

## Key Features
- **Customizable Token**: Name, symbol, and supply are set during deployment.
- **Transfer and Approval**: Basic token transfer functions with spender approval.
- **Minting and Burning**: Users can increase or decrease the total supply.
- **No OpenZeppelin Dependencies**: Lightweight and self-contained contract.
